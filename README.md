# Tensorflow Model Creator

This project will take the form of a python class that will generate, compile, train and evaluate a tensorflow model.


## Roadmap

- Tensorflow step up using public datasets

- Project model save and load

- Dynamic model creation using user's input

- Dynamic dataset preprocessing

- Dynamic model training and evaluation


If my understanding of ML is deep enough after these steps, the following will be added:

- Model layering recommendation usin ML

- Automatic dataset preprocessing

Future project related to the one will concern:

 - A web interface

 - An application interface

 - An API
